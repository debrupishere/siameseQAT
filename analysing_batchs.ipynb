      "Description of anchor 234284: build id i steps to reproduce step index copy some text to the clipboard step index open a java file step index fold the imports if they are not folded step index place the cursor at the start of the folded section step index select all step index paste the text does not get pasted the folded section is now unfolded and the cursor moved to the end of the folded section more information steps number and can be done in either order and it still fails this tends to come up when i open a new file because i have the comment on the top of the file folded and the cursor starts at the beginning of the file by default it seems like any foldable section can exercise this bug workaround perform select all and paste again because the folded section became unfolded it should work\n",
      "Description of pos 67500: this bug addresses the underlying issue that was flagged in bug please read that bug for background details i feel that further analysis of the use cases is required i think that the organization should never make the user type more keystrokes than are strictly required i think that once a user understands the concept of code folding they understand completely the implications of selecting one folded line and pressing delete or organization or organization or cut i think that the current behavior of having the code unfold number necessitating hitting delete again or number of the other keys in order to really delete is surprising and unwelcome when i select something in an editor and type delete i expect the selected stuff to disappear i do not expect to have a bunch of stuff appear in its place i was even further surprised to discover that sometimes the user needs to press delete n times where n is the number of levels of folded code so it is not just twice it is some potentially unbounded number of delete keystrokes required to finally delete that code\n",

      "Description of pos 167784: hi folks i think i finally discovered the root cause of the dreadful startup bug thread worker x timed out waiting ms for thread worker y to finish starting bundle org eclipse mylar tasks ui warning this is a very long bug in fact there are a set of bugs working together to make this happen or not according to the situation explanation bellow mylar plugins are doing expensive operations on organization i see that organization plugin do many heavy weight operations like reading the tasklist which involves organization parsing on plugin start method this type of operation must be made on a background job because the platform has a timeout of time for each plugin initialization the bundle activator start javadoc explicitly says that this method must return quickly product mylar plugins are doing expensive operations on display async exec taking a quick look i see that number organization and mylar team invoke display async exec long chain of method calls the problem here is that async exec forces the runnable to be executed on organization thread if the runnable takes much time to complete this causes organization to freeze probably this is the cause of organization freeze on product initialization i see the worst case here is on organization instead of simply wrapping a code block inside async exec we must track down the call stack and identify what methods requires to be executed on organization thread and wrap just them with async exec there is a circular dependency between context core and person this is the worst bug organization depends on context core ok however there is a involuntary dependency of context core on tasks organization because tasks organization provides a context store extension so context core activation triggers tasks organization activation while loading context store extensions and vice versa i think the easiest way to fix this is to move the filesystem based context store implementation to its own plugin like i suggested on bug i am suposing that the filesystem context store does not have any dependency on tasks organization classes this way this new plugin let us call it context filesystem store would depend only on context core context core activation would only trigger context filesystem core activation organization activation would trigger context core and so on conclusion there is a lot of problems contributing to make this bug happen sometimes sometimes depending on organization classloading policy and because of busy bundle activator start implementations bug step index can be triggered causing the plugin init timeout most times bug step index is causing bug step index to not happen i suppose that async exec would be masquerading the circular dependency otherwise tasks organization would trigger context core activation which would trigger tasks organization and so on probably the trigger code would be inside a async exec block so it is scheduled to run on organization thread letting the plugin complete initialization however on some vms oss the thread policy can be different making the deadlock plugin timeout happen taking a quick look at my bug list i can remember strong candidates for being dups of this bug mylar fails to start on organization jrockit product bug more startup errors after upgrading to test to investigate bug errors on startup all bugs containing thread worker x timed out waiting ms for thread worker y to finish starting bundle blablabla on stack trace so fixing these number problems would end the timeout problems\n",
